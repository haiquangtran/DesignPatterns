# Design Patterns

Repo for learning design patterns.
Implementation for learning design patterns based on the book: Head First Design Patterns by Eric Freeman, Elisabeth Robson, Bert Bates, Kathy Sierra.

###### Strategy Pattern
* Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. 

###### Observer Pattern
* Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.  

###### Decorator Pattern
* The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. 
* Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

###### Factory Pattern
* The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses. 

###### Singleton Pattern
* The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it. 

###### The Command Pattern
* Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize other objects with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
